### Game Instructions

If you don't have a webserver running, I found, on my mac, that I was simply able to run the below command from the project root directory. <code>ruby -run -e httpd . -p 5000</code> .If that works you should be able navigate to [localhost:5000/index.html](http://localhost:5000/index.html) in your browser to play the game.
